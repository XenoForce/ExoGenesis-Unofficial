# Important Information about Licensing:

**Current status:**

This collection of ExoGenesis assets (sprites, JSON/HJSON code, and playable Mindustry mod) have all been released to the public domain, under the GPLv3.

<br>

**Background Information:**

Originally, the author of ExoGenesis (AureusStratus) released the ExoGenesis mod to the world, under the GPLv3.

Unfortunately Aureus then later foolishly changed his license agreement (on Feb 28, 2022) to something that is now more restrictive. It is really questionable whether an author can actually make such a license retraction, once a project has been released to the public domain under the GPLv3, but we will leave that interesting legal discussion for another time.

Rather, I will explain here, how this particular project ("ExoGenesis-Unofficial") came into being.

<br>

**How this project was created:**

1.) A snapshot was taken of the original Exogenesis mod, as on 27 Feb. 2022. On this date, the Exogenesis mod was still released under the GPLv3, by its author.

2.) Extensive work was done on the JSON source code, in order to make the various components of the mod work under the v7 Mindustry game engine. (During this task, more than 500 source code commits were pushed/uploaded to the github source code repository.)

3.) In many cases, the original JSON source code was converted to the more user-friendly HJSON format and syntax.

4.) The project was continuously tested for errors and warnings against the v7 Mindustry game engine, until all errors and warnings were dealt with successfully.
