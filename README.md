# ExoGenesis-Unofficial
ExoGenesis Mod: Free version (Released under the GPLv3.)

<br>

**This project serves two purposes:**

1.) It is a fully playable version of the ExoGenesis mod for Mindustry, as it stood on 27 Feb 2022, before the author foolishly changed the licensing of the mod.

2.) This is a rich collection of free Mindustry assets (sprites, and JSON/HJSON code), which can be of great value to other Mindustry mod developers.

<br>

**Some Improvements:**

1.) The old source code (from 27 Feb. 2022) has been amended, in order to work under the v7 Mindustry game engine.

2.) In many cases, the original JSON source code has been converted to the more user-friendly HJSON format.

3.) In many cases, the Research cost of expensive components on the Tech Tree has been reduced. This makes it a lot easier (and faster) to unlock components on the Tech Tree.

4.) The various components of the ExoGenesis mod have been consolidated into a common node on the Tech Tree. This way, the ExoGenesis components are kept separate from the vanilla in-game components on the Tech Tree.

<br>

**WARNING:**

Fair warning to Mindustry players: This is effectively a cheat mod. This mod gives the player access to over-powered units and/or components. Don't use this mod, if you don't want the original game-play of the game spoiled for you!
